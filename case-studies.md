## Case Studies

### Small Kent-based building company wins more business with new H&S content

Amber Green Safety developed a health and safety policy supported by a health and safety management system and tender set. The inclusion of new health and safety content within the company’s tenders increased their win rate by 20% over a nine-month period.

### Accidents down, confidence up for 200-staff logistics company

We developed a safety management system that enabled our client to take a more consistent and confident approach to its health and safety commitment. As a result there was a significant decrease in accident and incident rates.

### Adult Learning Centres to enjoy full health and safety coverage for away days

We are currently providing consultation on health and safety for excursions run by adult learning centres. Even at this early stage of implementation it is expected that the systems and the training that is being delivered will enhance the organisation’s ability to effectively manage safety issues associated with running outside events.
